# hourly planner

hello! this is a clean hourly planner that lets you schedule things hour by hour

it is more personalized to me bc i wanted my own to use over google calendar

i wanted hourly blocks, monday to sunday, from 6 am to 10 pm

by clicking any time-slot, you can add an event, the categories of types of events (work, personal, study, other), are color coded

it has a to-do list for random stuff

a live clock showing what you are doing right then

you can plan ahead week by week

there is a useful duration feature if an event takes > 1 hour

its very simple!

thanks for reading.
